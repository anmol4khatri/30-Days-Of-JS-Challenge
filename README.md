# 30-days-of-JS-challenge
Welcome to my 30 Days of JS Challenge repository! Here, I have shared my daily updates and progress as I take on the "30 Days of JS Challenge" initiated by Hitesh Choudhary. Stay tuned for code snippets, projects, and learning experiences as I dive deep into JavaScript over the next 30 days.

## About the Challenge

In this 30-day challenge, each day is divided into multiple activities (topics), which are further divided into tasks (problems). This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript, from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure(Just an example)

- **Day 1**
  - Activity 1: Introduction to JavaScript
    - Task 1: Hello World
    - Task 2: Variables and Data Types
  - Activity 2: Basic Operators
    - Task 1: Arithmetic Operators

*(and so on for each day)*
